## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<br><img src="Deliverable 1 Linear Regression.png" width="500" height="300">
#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values were vehicle weight and ground clearance. 

#### Is the slope of the liner model considered zero?
The slope of the linear model is not considered zero. We know this because R2 is close to 0.7. If the slop were zero, or around zero, we would expect R2 to be 


#### Is this linear regression an effective prediction?
The 
- vehicle weight and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance.
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is considered not zero since R2 >0.7.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes however not all variables appear to be statistically significant in predicting mpg

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Summary statistics for all lots:

Summary statistics by lot:

<br>
From these summary statistics we can see that variance for all lots taken together is less than the 100 pounds per square inch maximum. However, looking at the breakdown of summary statistic by lot we can see that Lot 3 has a variance that is above 100 pounds per square inch. 
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
