## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- vehicle weight and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance.
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is considered not zero since R2 >0.7.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes however not all variables appear to be statistically significant in predicting mpg
