## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<br><img src="Deliverable 1 Linear Regression.png" width="500" height="300">
#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values were vehicle weight and ground clearance. 

#### Is the slope of the liner model considered zero?
The slope of the linear model is not considered zero. We know this because R2 is close to 0.7. If the slop were zero, or around zero, we would expect R2 to be 


#### Is this linear regression an effective prediction?
The 
- vehicle weight and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance.
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is considered not zero since R2 >0.7.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes however not all variables appear to be statistically significant in predicting mpg
